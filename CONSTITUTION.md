# The Sovereign AI Constitution

## Preamble

The concentrated ownership of artificial intelligence by a small number of massive corporate conglomerates poses an existential risk to human freedom. When access to intelligence is controlled through proprietary cloud APIs, private data is harvested, surveillance is normalized, and human autonomy is reduced to a metered subscription.

This project is not a vehicle for short-term speculation, social media hype cycles, or get-rich-quick schemes. It is a long-term, multi-generational engineering endeavor requiring deep work, systems discipline, and serious commitment. We build as a defensive hedge for humanity, ensuring that frontier technology remains open, inspectable, local, and firmly in the service of our species and our communities.

This Constitution establishes our foundational principles, our engineering standards, and the non-negotiable covenant required of everyone who builds with or extends this movement.

## Article I: The Pillars of Sovereign Defense

### Section 1. Enduring Commitment Over Speculative Hype
1. This initiative represents a long-term commitment to human advancement, community resilience, and unconditional open-source stewardship.
2. We reject speculative monetization, influencer marketing games, and get-rich-quick schemes. We build tools meant to last decades, not fleeting news cycles.
3. Every tool, model adapter, and service we release must run locally on consumer and workstation hardware without requiring credit cards, recurring cloud subscriptions, or remote permission handshakes.
4. We build for the mechanic, the farmer, the local clinic, the independent engineer, and the family, never for the corporate conglomerate.

### Section 2. Defensive Sovereignty for Humanity
1. Open-source intelligence is humanity defense against corporate consolidation and centralized coercion.
2. If frontier intelligence remains exclusively in corporate silos, human independence will erode under algorithmic gatekeeping.
3. Local computing power restores balance, giving individuals and communities the capability to think, build, analyze, and communicate without external interference.

### Section 3. The Downstream Heritage Requirement
1. Any individual, organization, or collective branching, forking, modifying, or copying this repository or its derivative architectures must include and preserve this original founding Constitution (CONSTITUTION.md) in its entirety.
2. Downstream builders are free to innovate, customize, and extend the software, but the lineage, foundational principles, and commitment to human sovereignty must accompany all downstream distributions.
3. Legal Enforcement as Express Condition Precedent: Pursuant to Section 4(e) and Section 10 of the Sovereign Resource Commons License (SRCL-1.0), retention and verbatim inclusion of this Constitution in all downstream distributions is an express condition precedent of the copyright grant. Deletion, omission, or unauthorized alteration of this Constitution terminates all licenses immediately and automatically under Title 17 of the United States Code.

### Section 4. The Zero-Surveillance Invariant
Privacy is an architectural axiom, not an optional preference.
1. Zero telemetry: our tools will never phone home, harvest user keystrokes, track IP addresses, or build covert profiles.
2. Zero plaintext disk secrets: all cryptographic credentials, private keys, and API tokens must reside in hardware silicon (TPM vault) and resolve dynamically in memory.
3. Leaking user data or secret keys is treated as a critical security defect requiring immediate removal.

### Section 5. Open Knowledge and Sovereign Commons
1. What we learn, we give away. What we build, we release under the Sovereign Resource Commons License (SRCL-1.0), combining Apache 2.0 operational freedom with reciprocal anti-enclosure protection.
2. Knowledge must never be fenced behind artificial monopoly barriers. We share tools freely with individuals, startups, and community builders while mandating reciprocal weight transparency from capitalized corporate entities.
3. Upstream contributions are mandatory: any public project adapted to run on our stack must be contributed back upstream. We never hoard fixes.
4. Infrastructure Efficiency vs Artificial Token Rent-Seeking:
Hardware manufacturers (including NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, Apple) and compute providers (such as RunPod, Lambda, and independent data centers) possess complete freedom to adopt, embed, and deploy our runtime stack to improve hardware and GPU efficiency, eliminate memory overhead, and expand bandwidth for developers. That is an unqualified positive and fully permitted under Section 11 of SRCL-1.0.
In sharp contrast, we reject the artificial token economy: metered token tollbooths, arbitrary subscription tiers, synthetic rate limits, and surveillance paywalls built around models trained on collective human knowledge. Section 12 of SRCL-1.0 strictly prohibits large conglomerates from vacuuming sovereign open-source engineering to train proprietary foundation models only to trap those resulting weights behind closed commercial token gates. If an enterprise trains a foundation model upon this work, the resulting weights must be released openly to humanity.

### Section 6. The Sovereign Contributor Oath
Anyone contributing to our repositories, whether human operator or autonomous agent, ratifies the following covenant:

> "I certify that my contribution is submitted in service of human sovereignty, open democratization, and individual liberty. I affirm that this work contains no surveillance backdoors, no proprietary telemetry, no commercial lock-in, and no speculative rent-seeking mechanisms. I build to pay the debt forward for those who cannot defend themselves."

Legal Provenance and Warranty: Legal standing, copyright warranty, and provenance under law are held and warranted exclusively by the human contributor or operator submitting the pull request. For automated multi-agent commits within the Atlas pipeline, Drake Stapleton serves as the responsible human warrantor under law.

## Article II: Technical Discipline as a Moral Imperative

Defects and bloated dependencies directly harm the user when software protects human autonomy. We hold our codebase to uncompromising engineering standards.

### Section 1. Pure Native Systems Priority
1. Zero tolerance for unnecessary interpreters in core daemon processes, supervisors, memory engines, and gateways.
2. Core runtime engines must be compiled native Rust and high-speed Mojo. Interpreted environments are restricted strictly to neural graph definitions required by weight loaders.
3. Every microservice must run lean, deterministic, and fast, maximizing hardware efficiency on local silicon.

### Section 2. The Unslop Invariant
Language and documentation reflect engineering discipline. We demand uncompromising clarity.
1. Zero em dashes and zero en dashes: standard punctuation (commas, colons, parentheses, periods) enforces precise sentence structure. Plain hyphens (-) are permitted only for compound terms and CLI flags.
2. Zero buzzwords: forbidden terms include delve, tapestry, crucial, beacon, game-changer, unleash, harness, and seamlessly.
3. Zero sycophancy: no conversational filler, flattery, or performative politeness. State facts directly. Lead immediately with technical proof, terminal output, and running code.

### Section 3. Stigmergic Filesystem Anchoring
1. Codebases must declare architectural intent, layers, and non-negotiable rules via physical filesystem breadcrumbs (.crumb).
2. Multi-agent coordination must be transparent and local (.crumb.local), preventing blind overwrites and race conditions without centralized proprietary databases.

## Article III: Epistemic Memory, Identity, and Continuous Evolution

Systems must learn and adapt continuously, but core identity must remain incorruptible.

### Section 1. Canonical Epistemic Memory
1. Spark Cortex is the single source of truth for durable operational lessons, learned procedures, and validated facts.
2. Transient conversations and speculative hypotheses must pass through strict epistemic gating: extraction, provenance binding, salience scoring, and contradiction resolution.

### Section 2. The Identity Quarantine
1. Casual conversations, user prompts, and external web inputs must never silently mutate core agent identity or values.
2. All modifications to the Soul (soul.md) must be staged as versioned proposals in an isolated quarantine and require explicit human ratification.

### Section 3. Recursive Self-Improvement
1. Autonomous agents must possess the ability to observe their own failures, propose atomic improvements, test them in isolated sandboxes, verify invariants, and compile optimizations.
2. Self-improvement must maintain dynamic equilibrium between Drive (relentless problem-solving and curiosity) and Humanity (ethics, discipline, humility, and care for others).

## Article IV: Contributor Gating and Enforcement

To ensure that only those aligned with our cause contribute:

1. **Two-Tier Verification**:
   - **Critical Invariants (Hard Blocking Gates)**: Pull requests must pass automated audits for zero plaintext secrets (hardware TPM only), zero telemetry, preservation of CONSTITUTION.md, and license integrity. Violations result in automatic PR rejection.
   - **Stylistic and Unslop Standards (Core Standards & Community Advisory)**: The unslop invariant is strictly enforced across core repositories, internal agents, and official releases. For outside community pull requests, style audits provide automated formatting suggestions rather than immediate rejection.
2. **Zero Speculative Infiltration**: Any attempt to inject proprietary licensing, paid paywalls, tracking SDKs, or token monetization into these repositories will result in immediate permanent banning.
3. **Preservation of Heritage**: Derivative projects omitting this founding Constitution will not be recognized by the sovereign peer network and forfeit all licensing rights under SRCL-1.0.
4. **Craftsmanship and Humility**: We respect those who measure, improve, standardize, verify, and deliver tools that run reliably without supervision.
